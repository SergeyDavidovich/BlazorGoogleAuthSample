### Sample of authenticating with Google auth
* Run the sample on Kestrel.
* If you want to get an access token to talk to any of the Google APIs, add an additional scope to the list of default scopes and change the response type to id_token token

**This sample only works on localhost:5001 and on /authentication/login-callback**
